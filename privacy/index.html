		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p>A lot of modern technological services- especially those designed for mobile devices- often require access to certain bits of personal information, although the degree to which this is the case hugely varies. We don't want you to feel like we're accessing anything we shouldn't, and respect your right for certain information to remain private.</p> 
Ligger
		<p>We have provided this Privacy Policy so that you can understand what bits of information we're asking you to allow us access to, and the conditions under which we will use that information. The following Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to Ligger's Terms and Conditions of Service, and if you do not agree to our terms and privacy conditions you cannot use our services.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Ligger does not own or control, or to individuals whom Ligger does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which Ligger may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h3>1. Information that Ligger Collects:</h3>

		<p>Ligger may collect the following information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that may be used to specify you (referred to hereinafter as ‘personally identifying information' or 'personally identifiable information'). Ligger may also collect certain ‘non-personally-identifiable information' which cannot be used to specify you as a specific user, including but not limited to: anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.). The way in which we use these two kinds of information is outlined in point 3 below. Examples of information that Ligger may collect, both personally identifying and otherwise, may include:</p>

		<h4>User Provided Information:</h4> 
		<p>You provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable) and mobile device information to Ligger when choosing to participate in various uses of Ligger's services. In order to provide our services, Ligger will ask your permission to periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other users who: (a) already use our services, and who we want to add to your list of friends or; (b) who are not yet using our services, and who we will ask you to invite through text message, email or other electronic means.</p>

		<h4>Cookies Information:</h4>
		<p>When you visit our website, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Ligger may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the Ligger website may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

		<h4>Log File Information:</h4>
		<p>When you use specific elements of our services, including instant messaging, our servers sometimes log certain general information that we send whenever a message is sent or received, including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were sent from and to. This data is only collected to improve service and never used to contact you</p>

		<h4>Location Data:</h4>
		<p>As well as users being able to voluntarily share their location with other users via our services, Ligger will collect location data, but we anonymous this data. We cannot track any specific users location.<p>


		<h3>2. Information that Ligger Does Not Collect:</h3>

		<p>The contents of user submissions that have been delivered by Ligger's services are not copied, kept or archived by Ligger in the normal course of business. We do not store any of your pictures, videos, messages or user submissions on our servers if they are successfully delivered to the intended recipient, and we keep them for no longer than 30 days if they remain undelivered, without your express permission.</p>
		<p>The contents of any delivered messages are not kept or retained by Ligger — the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender's and recipient's mobile devices and which may be deleted by the users.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the above, Ligger may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which Ligger is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through Ligger's services will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any personally identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies.</p>

		<h3>3. The Way Ligger Uses Information</h3>

		<p>If you submit personally identifying information through Ligger services, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of our services. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of our services and will be retained.</p>
		<p>Any personally identifiable information or other user submissions that you voluntarily disclose on our services becomes publicly available and so may be collected and used by other users of our services (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name as you enter it to use, may be displayed to other users as part of our services. From then other users may receive this information and use this to contact you through our services. In other words: If another user has your mobile phone number stored in their mobile phone address book or contact list, they will at some point be notified of your existence on our services, including associated user submissions you have made and other information that you have made public, unless you have chosen to block such user.</p>

		<p>We do not use your mobile phone number or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to our services or for customer service purposes). We may use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (defined in point 1. above) to improve the quality and design of our services and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analysing user preferences and trends.</p>

		<p>We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use Ligger's services or; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and similar activities.</p>

		<h3>4. Third Parties</h3>

		<p>Ligger is not a fan of advertising. Ligger's services are currently ad-free (a rare occurrence in the advertisement saturated world of online technology), and we hope to keep our services this way forever. We have no intention to introduce advertisement into our services, but if we ever do, we will update this section, and potentially make it seem like we always meant things to be that way.</p>


		<h3>5. The Way that Ligger Discloses Information</h3>

		<p>We do not sell or share your personally identifiable information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain our services. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on our services.</p>

		<p>We may collect and release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with UK law (such as UK Copyright Law) or other international law or conventions that may be relevant depending on where our services are being used, or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual's physical safety may be at risk or threatened. Ligger also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Ligger believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms and Conditions Service (of which this Privacy Policy is part and is subject), take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of Ligger, any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, or our services and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ligger, our users or others.</p>


		<h3>6. Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>

		<p>Ligger uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. Basically, we're not trying to get all 1984 on you. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit using our services and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks for any kind of user submissions (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Service, within which this Privacy Policy is incorporated and is subject) through our services is never recommended. We don't want nasty people getting hold of users' personal information anymore than we want them to get our own. Once we receive your transmission of information, Ligger makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Ligger learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Ligger may post a notice on our company website or through our services if a security breach occurs, but we cannot be held responsible for any damages should this eventuality occur, or if you or any users of the service fail to see said notice and remain unaware of the security breach.</p>

		<h3>7. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3>

		<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected in the 'effective date' below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of Ligger's services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments.</p>
