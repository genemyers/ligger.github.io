<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a Ligger?</h3>

<p>Legend has it that the term Ligger was coined by the Big Hair Glam bands of the '70s and '80s, for persons who attend parties, concerts, and festivals with the sole intention of obtaining free food and drink. It originated from the fishing term for a 'baited line', and was later popularised by NME Magazine in the '90s. Liggers know no boundaries; they're black, white red, yellow, brown, rich, poor, male, female and everything in between.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid the maze of characters in the field, as you move up the screen to find the bartender and get 2 beers, then return back to the start without spilling at least 1 beer, to level up.</p>
  
<p>Festival promotors Michael, John, Melvyn and Rob take turns escorting you backstage, at each level.</p>

<p>If you spill a beer, you can return to the bar to get yourself another, or just head back to the promotor with just one. If you spill both, that promotor is finished, but if you make it back with at least one, you've successfully ligged your way backstage and that promotor will queue up again to give you another chance to serve.</p>

<p>But get what you can, when you can, because at each level, things speed up.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scoring</h3>

<p>You score 10 points as you land on each row, or 20 points if you have two beers. You score 100 points when the bartender serves you. If you return with one beer, you score 500 points, and with two beers you score 1000 points. You also get a bonus of 10 points for every second played, multiplied by the number of levels reached.</p>
